**Week 1 of CS50X 2026**

_notes from second lecture_

lost some progress here from messing with branches. may save that for another lesson another time.

1/8:

- types
- functions, for/while loops, if...else
- prototypes
- scope
- correctness, design, style
- truncation

for some reason these changes are not getting pushed to github

noticed the pwd was not just the entire folder but the folder within the main one that housed the code for week 1 examples.
think that messed with the commands i was running and now i am not sure what is missing or not but i think i learned my lesson of
taking note of where i am in the directory before running git commands, especially staging, committing, and pushing. really need to get a better understanding of how branches work as well but this little lesson may prove to be helpful in the future. we will see.
